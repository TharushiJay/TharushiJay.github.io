I'm a Computer Science graduate from University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC), Sri Lanka. I graduated at the top of my batch with a GPA of 3.98/ 4.0 and the awards for
1. Student of the Year Award 2020, University of Colombo - For excellence in academics, sports, aesthetic and cultural, leadership, conduct and character.
2. Prof. Mohan Munasinghe Award in Computer Science 2020 - For achieving the highest GPA (3.98/ 4.0) in the Computer Science degree programme.
3. Prof. V. K. Samaranayake Memorial Medal 2020 - For the Most Outstanding Graduate of the UCSC.

My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, particularly applied NLP tasks such as information extraction, text generation, question answering, text summarization and chatbots. I'm also intrigued by research in Programming Languages, having worked in implementing a PL for over a year now developing language server features such as completions, code actions, signature help, hover, rename for the compiler backend of Ballerina Programming Language at WSO2.
